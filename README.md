# Introduction to C++

This repository contains the code and resources from my first university course, **Introduction to C++**. The course covers the fundamentals of C++ programming, including:

- Basic syntax
- Control structures
- Data types
- Functions
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- And more

The code in this repository demonstrates the key concepts learned throughout the course, along with sample exercises and projects. This repository serves as a personal reference and a learning log as I work through the material and improve my skills in C++ programming.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use these resources if you're also starting out with C++!
